IDE:
Kunna soka pa replayes for en viss hero, och da lista matcher och en verified player.
Steg 1: Hamta en lista pa verifierade spelare
Sedan most played heroes for en av dessa
Spara i mongo-db!

Steg 2: Visa alla heroes, inkl bild etc.

Todo:
- clean up code and tests, getting messy
- start focusing on uc 1 - play around with visual style and layout

UC1:
- Have a bar at the top with search criteria, drop down or search bar for hero.
- show a row: player, win/loss, k/d/a, match-id, date, link to game. Make it look good, with links to games/dotafire/etc. Show items.

UC2:
- scrape interesting matches (admin gui) - build on this mechanism to make it automatic. Keeping up to date, deleting old matches etc.

UC3:
- Make it look good and feel nice on heroku.

When UC1 and 2 are prefect - go to the community and ask for feedback.

UC3:
- introduce an algoritm for ranking matches, ordering. maybe reddit style voting? This is lower prio.
